# LoLAnalysis
I build League of Legends hypothesis, such as relation from rank and cs. and testify them with Riot API

As for March 23th, You have to install the following:  
Requests [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/]  
Spark [https://spark.apache.org/]  
Elasticsearch [https://www.elastic.co/jp/products/elasticsearch]

My plan is build a LoL web site with Django, Spark, Elasticsearch and Riot Game API
