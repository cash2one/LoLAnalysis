# LoLAnalysis
I build League of Legends hypothesis, such as relation from rank and cs. and testify them with Riot API

As for March 23th, You have to install the following:  
Requests [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/]  
Spark [https://spark.apache.org/]  
  
~~How To use
1. rename a file to apiKey.py from fakeApiKey.py and set your Riot own API Key  
2. Run getHighRankedSummonersId.py to get high rank summoer's Id  
3. Run getRankedGameList.py or getRecentGameListJson.py to get match id Â 
4. Run getGameJson.py to get detailed match information json~~

My plan is build a LoL web site with Django, Spark, Elasticsearch and Riot Game API
